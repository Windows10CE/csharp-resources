# Books for C#

## Beginner

### [C# Player's Guide](https://csharpplayersguide.com/)
Game-ified approach to learning C#, a fairly unique way to approach the learning of a programming language, and manages to keep a fun tone throughout. Highly recommended.

### [Head First C#](https://github.com/head-first-csharp/fourth-edition#how-to-get-head-first-c)
> First 4 chapters available free as a PDF on the linked GitHub repository!

(currently reading) A very large focus on small projects, and encourages trying problems before it gives you the answers. If you like exercises, this is the book I would pick. Highly encourage you to grab the paperback of this one and keep a pencil handy.

## Intermediate

### [C# In Depth](https://csharpindepth.com/)
Less of a learning resource, more of an index of C# features in chronological order from C#1.0 to about C#8.0. Not a good first book, but a fantastic reference resource along with the official documentation.
