### [Nick Chapsas](https://www.youtube.com/@nickchapsas)
Great C# content, generally short and to the point. He has a few paid courses that I've never seen, so can't say much about those.

### [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys/playlists)
Focused on game development with Unity. No longer creates content, but the content that exists is generally still helpful and informative content, if getting a little old.

### [C# Community Discord Solution1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLykyx5HcHRdbVXR8PYtcco52T9eN7nAPc)
Conference held by the C# Community Discord, has a few hours worth of good C# content.
